    <h1>Why You Should Watch 'The Witcher'</h1>

        <hr />
        
            <p>The Witcher is inarguably one of the best television adaptations of a game storyline. It also happens to be on as my background noise so I'm drawing inspiration from there. Enjoy this brief synopsis of why you to should be watching The Witcher.</p>

    <h2>Reasons</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Gerald of Rivia is an unparalleled monster killing bad***.

                    
                <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-rivia-a-disabled-protagonist">
                    <img src="../../assignments/../htmlCssProjects/assets/geralt-of-rivia-a-disabled-protagonist-1606232827944.jpg" alt="Geralt of Rivia" target="_blank" width="400px" height="300px" style="border-radius: 50px" />

                        <p>I'll give it to you that he's not the warmest, fuzziest protagonist this side of Netflix. But his character arc is impeccable. His monster killing skills are unmatched. If you enjoy a flawed hero then you will thoroughly enjoy following along with Geralt's many adventures.</p>

        </li>
            <li>The love story between Yennefer and Geralt</li>

                    alt="Yennefer and Geralt" width="400" height="200" />

                        <p>The love story between Geralt and Yennefer is captivating. It seems like every twist and turn takes their journey even deeper into the unexpected. If you're a sucker for a good <b>'will they, won't they'</b> storyline then you'll enjoy watching them.</p>
