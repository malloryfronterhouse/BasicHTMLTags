    <h1>Why You Should Watch 'The Witcher'</h1>

        <hr />
        
            <p>The Witcher is inarguably one of the best television adaptations of a game storyline. It also happens to be on as my background noise so I'm drawing inspiration from there. Enjoy this brief synopsis of why you to should be watching The Witcher.</p>

    <h2>Reasons</h2>

        <ul style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Gerald of Rivia is an unparalleled monster killing bad***.

                    
                <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-rivia-a-disabled-protagonist">
                    <img src="../../htmlCssProjects/assets/geralt-of-rivia-a-disabled-protagonist-1606232827944.jpg" alt="Geralt of Rivia" target="_blank" width="450px" height="250px" style="border-radius: 50px" />
            </a>

                <p>I'll give it to you that he's not the warmest, fuzziest protagonist this side of Netflix. But his character arc is
                impeccable. His monster killing skills are unmatched. If you enjoy a flawed hero then you will thoroughly enjoy
                following along with Geralt's many adventures</p>
        </li>
            <li>The love story between Yennefer and Geralt</li>

                    alt="Yennefer and Geralt" width="400" height="200" />

                        <p>The love story between Geralt and Yennefer is captivating. It seems like every twist and turn takes their journey even deeper into the unexpected. If you're a sucker for a good <b>'will they, won't they'</b> storyline then you'll enjoy watching them.</p>
            <li>Jaskier is the G.O.A.T sidekick

                <img src="../../htmlCssProjects/assets/the-witcher-joey-batey-jaskier-1639571025.jpg" alt="Jaskier and his lute" width="500" height="300" style="border-radius: 75px" />
            </li>

            <p>Listen...frankly Robin doesn't hold a candle to Jaskier. He's hilarious, lovable, and quite possibly the only person in the series that <i>can</i> get away with roasting Geralt like Jaskier does. He adds a much needed element of humor to a story that would otherwise be fairly dark. Plus his songs are very catchy. Good luck not dancing a jaunty jig as they play!</p>
            
            <li>Princess Cirilla and Geralt's Relationship

                <img src="../../htmlCssProjects/assets/does-ciri-become-a-witcher-1639759926875.webp" alt="Ciri and Geralt" width="500" height="250" />
            </li>

                <p>Princess Cirilla is the Child Surprise of Geralt. No she's not his blood child, but due to her orphan status he's the closest thing she has to a parent in Season 2. It's great to see the human element that Ciri adds to Geralt. Watching their psuedo father-daughter relationship unfold is incredibly heartwarming.</p>
